# Langchain Github Profiler Analyzer

This repository contains a **GitHub User Profile Analyzer** that leverages **LangChain, OpenAI, and DuckDuckGo** to generate an **informative markdown profile** for a GitHub user. The script fetches user data from the **GitHub API**, enhances it with **DuckDuckGo search results**, and processes the information using **GPT-4o-mini**.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Enhance data with DuckDuckGo search results** for a broader online presence.
-   **Generate a structured markdown profile** with OpenAI‚Äôs **GPT-4o-mini**.
-   **Store debug results in JSON** for easier troubleshooting.

## üìå How It Works

1. **User inputs a GitHub username.**
2. **The script fetches GitHub API data** (followers, repositories, etc.).
3. **DuckDuckGo search enhances the profile** with external links & references.
4. **LangChain processes the data** to generate a **detailed markdown summary**.
5. **Output is printed & stored** for further use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Python**
-   **LangChain** (for structured data processing)
-   **OpenAI API** (for GPT-based text generation)
-   **DuckDuckGo Search API** (for external data enrichment)
-   **GitHub API** (to fetch user details)
